To fix an issue with missing preview thumbnails for some
mp4 video files I need to change

    media_codecs_ffmpeg.xml
    media_codecs_google_video.xml

in framworks/av/media/libstagefright/data. To avoid to
maintain my own framwork/av with all the permanent 
rebasing, I patch these files prior to each build:

In the root of cm repo tree I issue:

patch -p1 <device/samsung/chagallwifi/patches/OMX-google-ffmpeg.diff

Patch long and prosper - cheers.
